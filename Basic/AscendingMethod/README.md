#### Define a Python function ascending(ls) that returns True,
#### if each element in its input list is greater than or equal to the element before it.
#### For empty list, it should be True.

#### Here are some examples to show how your function should work.
>>> ascending([]) #returns True
>>> ascending([3,3,4]) #returns True
>>> ascending([7,18,17,19]) #returns False
